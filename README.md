# Factorial of Any Number (Big Number Support)

This is a simple C++ program I wrote back when I had just completed learning the C++ language through CodeWithHarry’s course.  
At that time, I hadn’t started my DSA and logic journey, but I still tried to write the logic for factorial calculation entirely on my own — especially to handle **very large numbers** that can’t be stored in standard `int` or `long` types.

## 💡 Features

- Calculates factorials of large numbers (like 50!, 100!, etc.)
- Handles multiplication and addition manually using strings
- Gives you a peek into how logic can be built without using any STL or prebuilt big integer libraries

## 📁 Files

- `p10.cpp` – Main program file

## 🧠 What I Learned

- How to work with strings like numbers
- Manual carry handling for addition and multiplication
- Writing clean logic without any DSA foundation at the time

## 🚀 How to Run

Make sure you have a C++ compiler installed.

```bash
g++ p10.cpp -o p10
./p10
